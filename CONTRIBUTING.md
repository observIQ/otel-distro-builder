# 🤝 Contributing to OpenTelemetry Distribution Builder

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the OpenTelemetry Distribution Builder as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- 🐛 Reporting a bug
- 💡 Discussing the current state of the code
- 🔧 Submitting a fix
- ✨ Proposing new features
- 🎯 Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Issue that pull request!

## 🎯 Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer
3. Make sure the CI checks pass

## 🧪 Testing

We use pytest for testing. To run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

## 📝 Code Style

We use pylint for Python code linting. To run the linter:

```bash
make lint
```

## 📚 Documentation

- Update the README.md with any new features or changes
- Add inline documentation for complex code

## 🐛 Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/observIQ/otel-distro-builder/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We love feature requests! We want to make the OpenTelemetry Distribution Builder the best it can be. Please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/observIQ/otel-distro-builder/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) when creating a new feature request.
